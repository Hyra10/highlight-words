# Highlight Words/Sentences

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

This project is an MVP that tries to mimic the highlight functionality used in places like [medium.com](https://medium.com/) where you can highlight sentences and comment on them for your future reference.

I did it in 2020 when I was learning new things on Angular.

## Set up

you have to run `npm i` after that you can run `ng server` (more info about it in the `development server` section)

## Usage

When you go to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200), you will see a login form, to start using the app you have to register yourself, the login and registration are not secure and they just use local storage to save the user's data no real security or API connections.

The highlight functionality is per account so you can have multiple users with different highlight sentence

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
